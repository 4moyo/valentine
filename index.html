    <br><br>
    From the moment you came into my life, everything changed in the most beautiful way. You showed me what it truly means to feel safe, understood, and loved for who I really am. With you, I’ve found a place where my heart feels at peace.
    <br><br>
    I can’t lie, being with you makes everything feel real. I don’t have to pretend or hide—I can just be me, and that alone is priceless. Every smile of yours, every laugh, every little moment we share has become a memory I hold close to my heart.
    <br><br>
    I still remember when you said that if you truly love someone, you won’t give up on them. That statement stayed with me. You also said that anyone who wants you will have to suffer for you. I won’t lie—loving you may not always be easy, but if it means choosing you every day and standing firm no matter what, then I’m ready for that.
    <br><br>
    And I can’t forget the first time I noticed you at New Hope. You were the first person that caught my attention. From the day you forced me to eat chicken pie and made sure I ate it in front of you, to all our little fights and arguments, every moment has meant something to me. Even the fights. They became part of our story, part of what makes us us.
    <br><br>
    I don’t want to ruin anything we already have because what we share is special to me. But I also can’t keep quiet about how I truly feel. I love you. Deeply and truly. And I don’t want to lose you or see you taken by someone else. That’s why when you talk about your crushes, I act like I don’t pay attention—but the truth is, I do. It’s just hard for me because my heart is already choosing you.
    <br><br>
    I don’t promise perfection, but I promise effort. I promise loyalty, honesty, and respect. I promise to choose you every day, even when things aren’t easy. I want to grow with you, build with you, pray with you, laugh with you, and face life’s challenges hand in hand. I want to be the person you can always rely on, just as you are for me.
    <br><br>
    I know this might come as a shock. Maybe it feels like too much at once. Maybe you’re not ready. Maybe you don’t even fully understand how I feel right now—and that’s okay. I’m not trying to pressure you or rush you into anything.
    <br><br>
    I just need you to know that I really, really, really do love you. What I feel is real. It’s not a joke, not a phase, not something small. I’ve tried to keep it in, but my heart won’t let me pretend anymore.
    <br><br>
    Even if you need time… even if you’re confused… even if you’re not sure what to say right now—just know that my feelings are genuine. I care about you deeply. And no matter what happens, I just wanted you to know the truth of my heart.
    <br><br>
    I love you. Deeply and truly.`
